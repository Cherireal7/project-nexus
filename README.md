---Project Nexus is a server-rendered, responsive movie recommendation application built with Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, integrating the TMDB API for real-time content retrieval. It implements mood-based recommendation logic, dynamic routing for individual movie pages, and optimized image delivery via Next.js <Image> with responsive sizing. The UI employs adaptive layouts and a glassmorphic navigation bar, with state and data handling fully encapsulated in modular fetch utilities. Designed for performance and scalability, the app leverages server-side data fetching for SEO benefits and reduced client payload, with an architecture ready for future PWA integration and extended filtering capabilities.
